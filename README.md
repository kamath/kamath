I'm the cofounder of [Smithery](https://smithery.ai), the largest open marketplace for MCP servers. 

Before, I've worked on:
* AI at 🅱️ Browserbase (Tech/Product Lead, Engineer #5). I was responsible for (and/or a top contributor to):
  * **🤘 [Stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand)**: the most popular AI browser automation SDK ([500k weekly downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@browserbasehq/stagehand)).
  * **[Browserbase MCP](https://github.com/browserbase/mcp-server-browserbase)**: one of the very first MCP servers (published within 24 hours of MCP's original release)
  * **[Open Operator](https://github.com/browserbase/open-operator)**: a simple open-source browser agent
  * **[Director](https://director.ai)**: a closed-source SOTA browser agent by Browserbase, powered by Stagehand
* 💛 Feed ranking and personalization at [Whatnot](https://whatnot.com).

I've also had a few side quests and stints at being a founder before. Check out:
* [Barbell](https://github.com/kamath/barbell-monorepo): an SDK I made for building Slackbots
* [dotcom.chat](https://github.com/kamath/dotcom.chat): an early and simple MCP client
