I'm the cofounder of [Smithery](https://smithery.ai), the largest open marketplace for MCP servers. 

Before, I've worked on:

* 🤘 Making [Stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand), the [most downloaded](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@browserbasehq/stagehand) AI browser automation framework (500k weekly downloads) as a Tech Lead at 🅱️ [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com). I also contributed to:
  * **[Browserbase MCP](https://github.com/browserbase/mcp-server-browserbase)**: one of the very first MCP servers (published within 24 hours of MCP's original release)
  * **[Open Operator](https://github.com/browserbase/open-operator)**: a simple open-source browser agent
  * **[Director](https://director.ai)**: a closed-source SOTA browser agent by Browserbase, powered by Stagehand
* 💛 Feed ranking and personalization at [Whatnot](https://whatnot.com)
